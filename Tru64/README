This directory includes most of the source code for AdvFS
as shipped for Tru64.  This includes the kernel components,
commands and libraries.

It was necessary to omit a few inconsequential files due to 
license requirements but the source code is complete enough 
to be a good reference for anyone interested in integrating 
similar features into existing or new GPLv2 file systems.
We recommend reviewing the design documentation, specifically
the hitchhikers guide, that is also available at this site.  

The code will not compile on a Tru64 system and we discourage 
Tru64 users from trying to build and use this code on Tru64 
systems as it will not be supported by HP.
