This directory includes the source code for a second generation 
implementation of AdvFS, including the kernel modules, commands
and utilities.  

This is the code that was ported to HP-UX.  It is functionally 
complete and went through fairly extensive functional and stress 
testing.  However, it should be considered beta quality and so 
you may spot bugs.  It is recommended that you review the
design documentation which is also available at this site
as it will guide you through the major subsystems.

This code will not build on HP-UX because it requires a
specialized build environment.  HP-UX users are discouraged
from attempting to build or use this code on HP-UX as it will
not be supported by HP.
